# Forescasting-Power-generated-by-a-WindTurbine
Using SARIMA/ LSTM/ RandomForest/ XGBoost

Project Description: We will be looking at Windturbine data and use the time-series dataset to forecast the power generated for the next 15 days based on the Windspeed.


Project tasks:

*Import the data
*Exploratory data analysis - using pandas profiling and then some boxplots.
*Missing values
*Graph power production
*Graph together
*What about other correlations ?
*Look for a pattern of power generation versus wind speed.
*Define a function to plot this graph and then use curve_fit from scipy to solve for the optimal parameters and finally graph against the measured values. *Transparency of measured values is set very low - hence the outliers look like they have disappeared
*SARIMA
*Accuracy statistics 
*Now to investigate some other models to see if a better prediction can be made- XGBoost/ Random Forest
*LSTM prediction
*Results and discussion
